🔭 I’m currently working on
FixItAll (my Final Year Project), a service marketplace built with the MERN stack (Node.js, Express, MongoDB). 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
Full-stack web applications, real-time Chatbot interfaces, or E-commerce platforms. 

🤝 I’m looking for help with
Advanced UX Design principles and Node.js backend optimization strategies. 

🌱 I’m currently learning
Node.js Backend Best Practices and the Foundations of UX Design. 

💬 Ask me about
MERN Stack development, React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, or how I transformed an offline plastic business into a digital marketplace. 

⚡ Fun fact
I engineered a complete e-commerce solution for a traditional plastic products business, moving their entire catalog online using WordPress and WooCommerce.
